# Weapon Rules

These expanded rules provide additional tactical options and risks when using automatic weapons, making their use more dynamic and engaging in the game. 

1. Burst Fire: Automatic weapons can fire in short bursts, consuming more ammunition but increasing the chances of hitting the target. When using burst fire, the player can choose to spend an additional 2 Action Points (total of 5) for a Standard Action to shoot a burst. For each burst, the player rolls an additional attack die. The player can use the highest result among the rolled dice for their attack.
2. Full Auto: Automatic weapons can also be fired in full auto mode, consuming a lot of ammunition but potentially dealing massive damage. When using full auto, the player must spend a Full Action (5 Action Points) and designate a number of targets within range (up to the weapon's maximum targets). The player rolls one attack die per target, applying appropriate modifiers to each. For each successful attack, the target takes the weapon's base damage plus any additional damage based on the margin of success.
3. Ammunition Consumption: When using burst fire or full auto, the weapon consumes more ammunition. The player should track their ammunition usage and reload their weapon when necessary. Reloading can be a Standard Action (3 Action Points), and players may need to carry additional magazines or ammo to sustain fire.
4. Recoil and Control: Automatic weapons can be harder to control due to recoil. When firing in burst or full auto mode, the player may receive a penalty to their attack rolls based on the weapon's recoil rating. This can be mitigated with skills, tags, or equipment that improves the character's ability to control automatic weapons.
5. Weapon Jamming: Automatic weapons have a chance to jam when fired in burst or full auto mode. After rolling for an attack, if the player rolls a natural 1 on any of the dice, there's a chance the weapon jams. The player must roll a separate d6, and if the result is another 1, the weapon jams and cannot be used until cleared. Clearing a jam can be a Standard Action (3 Action Points).
