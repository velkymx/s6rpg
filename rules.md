In this roleplaying game, players follow a set of rules that dictate their characters' actions and abilities. The game involves rolling a six-sided die (d6) to determine the outcome of various actions. Players also have the option to customize their characters with different abilities and attributes.

1. Rolling Dice: Players roll a d6 and add a modifier to the result. Modifiers can be a straight number (e.g., +2) or another dice roll (e.g., +1d6). The bonus level increases in the following order: +1, +2, +d6.
2. Advantage and Disadvantage: When a player has an advantage, they roll twice and take the highest result. When a player has a disadvantage, they roll twice and take the lowest result.
3. Natural Roll: A natural roll occurs when a player rolls a specific number on the die without any modifiers. For example, a natural 6 is when the die shows a 6.
4. Exploding Dice: If a player rolls a natural 6, they can "explode" the die, rolling an additional d6 and adding it to the total result. This can continue as long as they keep rolling 6s.
5. Failing and Levels of Failure: Rolling a natural 1 is considered a "fail." In this case, players roll another d6 to determine the level of failure:
	◦ 4-6: Success with consequences
	◦ 2-3: Failure
	◦ 1: Failure with a setback
6. Bennies: Each character receives one "benny" or token per game, which can be used to force a reroll of any dice roll.
7. Goocher: If a player rolls three natural 6s during any check, the action is an automatic success.
8. Target Number: The target number is the value a player must meet or exceed to succeed at an action.
9. Character Attributes: Characters have various stats that determine their abilities, including Move, Melee, Ballistics, Fortitude, Wits, Personality, Action Points, Health, Defense, and Save. Each stat has a specific function, such as Melee providing bonuses to attacks with handheld weapons.
10. Tags: Characters can gain one "tag" per level, providing a +2 bonus when applied to an action. Tags are specific to character classes.
11. Character Customization: Players can create unique characters by selecting a class (e.g., Barbarian, Rogue, Wizard), species (e.g., Elf, Human), and background (e.g., Ex-Soldier, Priesthood, Nobility).
12. Actions and Action Points: Characters can perform various actions during their turn, using action points (typically 5) to determine the number and type of actions they can take.
13. Turn and Initiative: Each turn lasts approximately 10 seconds in-game. Before taking actions, all players (and the Game Master) roll for initiative, determining the order of actions from highest to lowest.
14. Equipping Items: Characters can equip items in specific slots, such as hands, head, neck, body, wrists, fingers, legs, and feet.
15. Attacking and Damage: Players roll the appropriate stat (Melee or Ballistics) and add any weapon bonuses to determine if an attack hits. Any value exceeding the target's Defense reduces the target's Health. Players can also make saving rolls to nullify damage.
16. Consequences: Instead of taking damage, players can choose to take a negative tag in exchange for reducing the damage taken.
17. Character Death: When a character's Health reaches zero, they are killed or removed from the game.

## Hand-to-Hand Combat Example

Let's set up a combat scenario between two characters, Alice (a Rogue) and Bob (a Barbarian).

Alice's Stats:

* Move: 8" (40 ft)
* Melee: +3
* Ballistics: +5
* Fortitude: +2
* Wits: +4
* Personality: +2
* Action Points: 5
* Health: 10
* Defense: 3 (Fortitude +2 and small target bonus +1)
* Save: 6
* Tags: "Sneak Attack" (+2 when attacking from behind)

Bob's Stats:

* Move: 8" (40 ft)
* Melee: +5
* Ballistics: +1
* Fortitude: +4
* Wits: +2
* Personality: +1
* Action Points: 5
* Health: 15
* Defense: 6 (Fortitude +4, Armor +2)
* Save: 6
* Tags: "Power Strike" (+2 when using a two-handed weapon)
* Equipment: Leather Armor (+2)

Both Alice and Bob roll for initiative. Alice rolls a 5 and Bob rolls a 3. Since Alice has the higher initiative, she goes first.

Alice's Turn (Round 1):

She spends 2 Action Points to move behind Bob for a sneak attack. Then, she uses 3 Action Points for a Standard Action to attack with her dagger. She rolls a d6 for her attack, getting a 4, and adds her Melee modifier (+3) and "Sneak Attack" tag bonus (+2), totaling 9. Since 9 is higher than Bob's Defense (6), her attack hits for 3 damage (9 - 6), plus the dagger damage for a total of 5. Bob's Health drops from 15 to 10.

Bob's Turn (Round 1):

He uses 3 Action Points for a Standard Action to attack Alice with his two-handed sword. He rolls a d6 for his attack, getting a 5, and adds his Melee modifier (+5) and "Power Strike" tag bonus (+2), totaling 12. His attack easily surpasses Alice's Defense (3). Bob's attack hits for 9 damage (12 - 3), plus the two-handed sword damage for a total of 14. Alice chooses to use her "Save" ability, rolling a d6 for each point of damage. She gets two 6s, nullifying 2 points of damage. Her Health drops from 10 to -2. Alice is taken out of the game.

## Alternatives to Damage

Instead of taking damage, players can choose to take a negative tag in exchange for reducing the damage taken. Here are 20 tags that could negatively impact a player and their effects on their stats:

* Limpy: -2 to Move, -1 to Fortitude, -1 to Defense.
* Concussed: -1 to Wits, -1 to Personality, -1 to Defense.
* Deafened: -2 to Ballistics, -1 to Personality, -1 to Defense.
* Exhausted: -1 to Move, -1 to Ballistics, -1 to Fortitude, -1 to Defense.

* Poisoned: -1 to Fortitude, -1 to Wits, -1 to Defense.
* Stunned: -1 to Action Points, -1 to Defense.
* Disarmed: -2 to Ballistics, -2 to Melee, -1 to Defense.

* Crippled: -2 to Move, -2 to Fortitude, -2 to Defense.
* Terrified: -2 to Personality, -1 to Wits, -1 to Defense.
* Confused: -1 to Wits, -1 to Personality, -1 to Defense.
* Disoriented: -1 to Ballistics, -1 to Fortitude, -1 to Defense.
* Nauseated: -1 to Fortitude, -1 to Wits, -1 to Defense.
* Burned: -2 to Fortitude, -1 to Defense.
* Paralyzed: -3 to Action Points, -3 to Defense.
* Dazed: -1 to Wits, -1 to Defense.
* Mutilated: -4 to Fortitude, -3 to Defense.

## Hacking Example

In this scenario, let's introduce a new character, Charlie, who will attempt to hack a military-grade computer.

Charlie's Stats:

* Wits: 4
* Tags: "Master Hacker" (+2 to hacking actions)

Target Number: Hacking a military-grade computer is a challenging task, so the Game Master (GM) sets the target number at 12.

Charlie's Turn:

Charlie spends 3 Action Points for a Standard Action to attempt hacking the computer. He rolls a d6 for his hacking attempt, getting a 4. He adds his Wits modifier (+4) and "Master Hacker" tag bonus (+2), totaling 10. The roll is below the target number, so Charlie's initial hacking attempt fails.

The GM allows Charlie to spend a Benny to reroll his hacking attempt. Charlie spends his Benny and rolls a d6 again, getting a 6. The die explodes, and he rolls another d6, getting a 2. With his Wits modifier (+4) and "Master Hacker" tag bonus (+2), his total is now 14, which is higher than the target number (12). This time, Charlie successfully hacks into the military-grade computer, overcoming its advanced security measures.

## Bluff Example

In this scenario, let's introduce a new character, Diane, who will attempt to bluff her way past a security guard.

Diane's Stats:

* Personality: 5
* Tags: "Master of Disguise" (+2 to bluffing actions)

Target Number: Bluffing past a security guard is a difficult task, so the Game Master (GM) sets the target number at 10.

Diane's Turn:

Diane approaches the security guard and tries to convince him that she is a high-ranking military officer, there to perform a surprise inspection. She spends 3 Action Points for a Standard Action to attempt her bluff. She rolls a d6 for her bluffing attempt, getting a 3. She adds her Personality modifier (+5) and "Master of Disguise" tag bonus (+2), totaling 10. The roll meets the target number, so Diane's bluff is successful.

The security guard, convinced by Diane's disguise and authoritative demeanor, allows her to pass without question. Diane continues on her mission, having successfully bluffed her way past the security guard.

## Character vs Drone Combat Example

In this scenario, let's introduce a new character, Eric, who will engage in combat against a security drone.

Eric's Stats: Ballistics: 4 Tags: "Sharpshooter" (+2 to ranged attacks) Weapon: Laser Pistol (2 damage)

Security Drone's Stats: 

* Defense: 7 (+2 armor) 
* Health: 15 
* Save: 5

Eric's Turn: 

Eric spends 3 Action Points for a Standard Action to attempt a ranged attack on the security drone with his laser pistol. He rolls a d6 for his attack, getting a 5. He adds his Ballistics modifier (+4) and "Sharpshooter" tag bonus (+2), totaling 11. Since 11 is higher than the drone's Defense (7), his attack hits for 4 damage (11 - 7), plus the laser pistol's damage for a total of 6.

Security Drone's Turn: 

The drone attempts to use its Save ability, rolling a d6 for each point of damage. It rolls 1, 3, 4, 6, 6, and 6. The drone successfully saves 3 points of damage (rolling 5 or higher). Its Health drops from 15 to 12.

The security drone counterattacks Eric on its turn, but we'll focus on Eric's attack for this example. The combat continues with Eric trying to take down the security drone while avoiding its counterattacks.
