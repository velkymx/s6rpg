# Psychic Rules

These expanded rules provide a framework for incorporating psychic abilities into your game, adding a new layer of depth and strategy for players to explore.

1. Psychic Powers: Introduce a list of psychic powers that players can choose from when creating their characters or leveling up. Each power should have a description of its effects, range, duration, and any other relevant details. Powers can include telekinesis, mind reading, precognition, pyrokinesis, and more.
2. Psychic Stat: Add a new stat called "Psychic" or "Psi" that represents a character's psychic prowess. This stat is used when determining the effectiveness of psychic powers, much like Melee or Ballistics for physical attacks. Characters with psychic abilities would invest points in this stat to increase their psychic potential.
3. Psychic Tags: Create tags specific to psychic abilities, which can enhance or modify a character's psychic powers. These tags can provide bonuses to specific powers, grant additional effects, or improve the character's ability to resist psychic attacks.
4. Power Points (PP): Introduce a resource called "Power Points" that represents a character's psychic energy. Psychic powers consume Power Points when used, and characters must manage this resource carefully to avoid psychic exhaustion. Power Points can be restored through rest, meditation, or other means determined by the Game Master.
5. Psychic Actions: Psychic powers can be used through various types of actions, such as Standard Actions (3 Action Points), Full Actions (5 Action Points), or Quick Actions (2 Action Points), depending on the power's complexity and intensity. Some powers may also be passive, providing constant benefits without the need for an action.
6. Psychic Save: Add a new Save stat called "Psychic Save" or "Psi Save," which represents a character's ability to resist psychic attacks or effects. When targeted by a psychic power, a character can roll a d6, and if the result meets or exceeds their Psychic Save, they can reduce or negate the effect.
7. Psychic Duels: In situations where two psychic characters engage in a battle of wills, introduce a "Psychic Duel" mechanic. Both characters can roll their Psychic stat, adding any relevant tags and modifiers. The winner of the duel can impose psychic effects on their opponent, such as temporary stat reduction, mental domination, or other consequences determined by the Game Master.
8. Psychic Drawbacks: Using psychic powers can have drawbacks, such as mental strain or physical exhaustion. Characters might suffer temporary penalties after using powerful psychic abilities or experience negative side effects if they push their psychic powers beyond their limits.

## Example Psychic Encounter:

The players are exploring a haunted mansion, searching for clues about a missing person. Suddenly, they hear a strange humming noise coming from upstairs. They cautiously climb the stairs, weapons at the ready.

As they approach the door to the master bedroom, they hear a voice in their minds. It's a telepathic message, asking them to leave the mansion and never come back. The players realize they are dealing with a psychic opponent.

The group's psychic character decides to use Mind Reading to determine the source of the telepathic message. They spend 4 Power Points and roll their Psychic stat, adding the Telepathy tag. The Game Master reveals that the source of the message is a ghostly apparition that has taken up residence in the master bedroom.

The players decide to confront the ghost, knowing that they must use their own psychic powers to stand a chance against it. The psychic character uses Force Field to create a protective barrier around the group, spending 4 Power Points and rolling their Psychic stat, adding the Force Manipulation tag.

The ghost responds by using its own psychic powers, launching a Psychic Blast at the group. The players roll their Psychic Saves, trying to avoid the mental damage. One player fails their save and takes 3 points of mental damage, but they manage to reduce the damage by taking the tag "Mental Strain," reducing their Psychic stat by 1.

The psychic character decides to launch a counterattack, using Psychic Blast against the ghost. They spend 5 Power Points and roll their Psychic stat, adding the Psychic Attack tag. The attack hits the ghost, dealing significant damage and forcing it to flee the mansion.

As the group leaves the mansion, they realize that their encounter with the ghost was just the beginning of their psychic journey. They must hone their psychic abilities and learn new powers if they hope to face the other dangers that lurk in this world.
